# Super Encryption Standard

this is a low budget implementation of 64 bit key DES (data encryption standard). DES is no longer used and is considered insecure. Not even 3DES (which is just DES ran 3 times) holds up in modern times. So, this academic re-implementation should be deemed the worst block cipher available in the whole world wide web.
